# Loan Approval Model

This repository contains a Machine Learning model designed to assist loan managers in making informed loan approval decisions based on historical financial data. The model predicts whether a loan should be approved or denied using various machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes and identifies patterns in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts relevant features for better model performance.
- **Model Training:** Implements multiple machine learning models for prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Analyzes model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Automation with SQL:** Integrates PostgreSQL to streamline decision-making for loan managers.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn psycopg2
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoanApprovalModel.git
   cd LoanApprovalModel
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LoanApprovalModel.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells in sequence to preprocess data, train models, and generate loan approval predictions.

## Project Workflow
